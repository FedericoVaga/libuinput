This is a very simple library for the Linux's uinput char device.

I found others libraries for uinput but I do not like them because of their
java oriented solution. I think that a library must be simple to use, easy
to understand and hide some complexity. The uinput interface is pretty simple,
so this library does not simplify nothing; the aim of this library is to hide
the ioctl() interface to the user of this library and provide some common
functions.
