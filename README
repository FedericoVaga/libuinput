This is a very simple library for the Linux's uinput char device.

I found others libraries for uinput but I do not like them because of their
java oriented solution. I think that a library must be simple to use, easy
to understand and hide some complexity. The uinput interface is pretty simple,
so this library does not simplify nothing; the aim of this library is to hide
the ioctl() interface to the user of this library and provide some common
functions.

 Thanks to the question of Stack Overflow, I improved my library with the
 answer that I gave on the website:

 * The library determines the associated event char device of the uinput
   device just created
 * Export function to retrieve information about the device created:
     + event device number
     + char device path to the event device in /dev/input/
     + input device number
- - libuinput 0.1 - -
 * Create the first draft of the library
