# Changelog

## [0.2.0]
Thanks to the question of Stack Overflow, I improved my library with the
answer that I gave on the website:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15623442/how-do-i-determine-the-files-corresponding-to-a-uinput-device/15637288

### Added
- The library determines the associated event char device of the uinput
   device just created
- Export function to retrieve information about the device created:
    + event device number
    + char device path to the event device in /dev/input/
    + input device number
## [0.1.0]
Create the first draft of the library
